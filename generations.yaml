  - name: "First Generation (KJ)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The Jeep Liberty (sold as the Cherokee in markets outside North America) was introduced as a replacement for the Cherokee (XJ), featuring more rounded styling that departed from its boxy predecessor. Built on a new platform with rack-and-pinion steering and an independent front suspension with coil springs (while maintaining a solid rear axle), it attempted to balance improved on-road comfort with continued off-road capability. Powered primarily by a 3.7L PowerTech V6 producing 210 HP, with a 2.4L four-cylinder available as a base engine in some years, plus diesel options in international markets. Transmission options included a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual, with either Command-Trac part-time or Selec-Trac full-time four-wheel drive systems available. The interior offered more contemporary design and improved materials compared to the utilitarian Cherokee it replaced, with available features including power accessories, premium audio, and heated leather seats on higher trims. Unique features included an available sky slider roofâ€”a large canvas sunroof that opened nearly the entire length of the roof. This generation established the Liberty as a more mainstream compact SUV while attempting to maintain enough off-road capability to satisfy traditional Jeep customers."

  - name: "Second Generation (KK)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The second-generation Liberty featured more angular, aggressive styling with boxier proportions that referenced classic Jeep design cues. Built on an updated platform, it maintained the independent front suspension/solid rear axle layout but with revised geometry for improved handling. Power came primarily from the same 3.7L PowerTech V6, now producing 210 HP and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options streamlined to a four-speed automatic, later replaced by a six-speed automatic, with either Command-Trac II part-time or Selec-Trac II full-time four-wheel drive systems available. The interior saw improvements in design and material quality, though still focused more on durability than luxury. Notable features included the Sky Slider full-length canvas roof and an available MyGIG infotainment system with navigation and hard drive-based music storage. Off-road capability remained a priority with the Trail Rated badge available on properly equipped models. Production ended in 2012 as Jeep prepared to consolidate its lineup, effectively replacing both the Liberty and Patriot with the new Cherokee (KL) introduced for 2014. The Liberty represented Jeep's attempt to modernize its compact SUV offerings while maintaining core brand values, serving as a transitional model between the iconic but dated Cherokee (XJ) and the more crossover-oriented Cherokee (KL) that followed."
